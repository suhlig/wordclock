# Ruby Word Clock

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/suhlig/wordclock.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/suhlig/wordclock)

This is an implementation of a [Word Clock](http://www.instructables.com/id/Wordclock/) in Ruby. It maps every point in time between midnight and 23:59 hours to a sentence, which is represented as positions of pixels to light up. The current implementation uses German words.

The LEDs are driven by a [Fadecandy](https://github.com/scanlime/fadecandy) board using [faderuby](https://github.com/JamesHarrison/faderuby).

The hardware setup was largely inspired by the [WordClock mit WS2812](https://www.mikrocontroller.net/articles/WordClock_mit_WS2812) article at [mikrocontroller.net](https://www.mikrocontroller.net/). It uses it's [24 hours version](https://www.mikrocontroller.net/wikifiles/1/12/WordClock24h-Frontplatte-800x800.png) as character table.

# LED Indices

The following table shows the positions for a single, continuous strip of LEDs. Read from top to bottom, with the MSB in the top row:

# Development

This is a regular Ruby project, i.e. after cloning the project, the usual

```bash
$ bundle install
$ bundle exec rake
```

will get you started with running the tests.

For further investigation, there is also a terminal simulator that shows a text version of the clock in action:

  ```bash
  $ bundle exec exe/word-clock-simulator "12.11.2017 17:23"
  ```

  ![17:23](doc/simulator_1723.png)

It's even prettier when the party mode is enabled (e.g. on Shrove Tuesday):

  ```bash
  $ bundle exec exe/word-clock-simulator "28.2.2017 23:59"
  ```

  ![Party Mode](doc/simulator_party-mode.png)

# Deployment

See [deployment](deployment/README.markdown) for details.

# Web Application

## Server

```
$ bundle install
$ PORT=4567 SSE_EVENTS_URL=http://localhost:4567/stream bundle exec foreman start
$ open http://localhost:4567/
```

If you just want to listen in with `curl`:

```
$ curl -s -H "Accept: text/event-stream" http://localhost:4567/stream
```

## Client

The `word-clock` script will post a message to where `$SSE_POST_URL` points. The server will then send an update event via SSE to all connected web browsers, which will show an updated event list.

# Troubleshooting the WS2811B LEDs

## Wiring

I accidentally killed a number of LEDs with a ground loop because the Raspberry Pi and the soldering iron were connected to different wall sockets.

To find out whether an LED is dead, someone in [the forum](https://www.mikrocontroller.net/topic/385955) recommended to measure the resistance between `DATA` and `GND`:

* If the resistance is between 2 and 15 MΩ, the LED is ok.
* If the resistance is ∞, the LED is dead.

Since then, this is my safety procedure when soldering LEDs:

1. Connect `GND` of soldering iron to `GND` of the LED strip to be soldered
1. Connect `GND` of power supply to `GND` of the LED strip to be soldered
1. Solder black wire to `GND` of LED strip
1. Solder red wire to `+5V` of LED strip
1. Connect `GND` of Fadecandy to LED strip
1. Connect `DATA` of Fadecandy to LED strip
1. Connect Fadecandy to USB
1. Connect `+5V` of power supply to LED strip
1. Start test

## Software Tests

* `fadecandy` comes with a number of useful examples that can exercise a number of LEDs:

  ```bash
  $ cd ~/workspace/fadecandy/examples/perl
  $ ./random.pl; ./turnthemoff.pl
  ```

  Having `random.pl` and `turnthemoff.pl` in one line ensures that all LEDs are turned off when `random.pl` is interrupted.

* Tailing the log file

  Assuming that `wordclock` is the host, the following will tail entries related to  `fcserver` from the system journal:

  ```bash
  ssh wordclock sudo journalctl -u fcserver -f
  ```

  Once a client connects, it will show a line similar to this:

  ```
  Dec 17 18:07:52 wordclock fcserver[684]: [1481994472:2735] NOTICE: New Open Pixel Control connection
  ```
